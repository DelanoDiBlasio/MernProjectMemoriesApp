## Introduction
This is a video tutorial I watched to learn to create a mern app - https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6QREj8te1P7VSwhrMf3D3Xt4V6_SRkhu.

Using React, Node.js, Express & MongoDB from start to finish. The App is called "Memories" and it is a simple social media app that allows users to post interesting events that happened in their lives.

click on the memories logo anytime you want to go back to the home page.


## Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the app

TODO: rename post message, refactor reducers, add some cool memories, maybe clickable tags, fix update functionality

## upload:
Unfortunatly heroku is not letting me deploy my application I have tried to do this but isn't working.
